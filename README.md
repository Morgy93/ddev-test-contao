# test-contao

This repository is used for automated tests to test a Contao installation.

The repository was created using the `composer create` command, following the techniques described in the [documentation for installing Contao from the command line](https://docs.contao.org/manual/en/installation/install-contao/#installing-contao-from-the-command-line) and the [DDEV quickstart guide for Contao](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/quickstart/#contao).

The installation is based on the [Contao Demo 5.3](https://github.com/contao/contao-demo/tree/5.3).
